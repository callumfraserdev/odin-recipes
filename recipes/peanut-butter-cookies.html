        <p>These are simple three ingredients, cookies that everyone will love.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>200g peanut butter</li>
            <li>175g golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>¼ tsp fine table salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>STEPS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line 2 large baking trays with baking parchment.</li>
            <li>Measure the peanut butter and sugar into a bowl. Add ¼ tsp fine table salt and mix well with a wooden spoon. Add the egg and mix again until the mixture forms a dough.</li>
            <li>Break off cherry tomato sized chunks of dough and place, well spaced apart, on the trays. Press the cookies down with the back of a fork to squash them a little. The cookies can now be frozen for 2 months, cook from frozen adding an extra min or 2 to the cooking time.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12 mins, until golden around the edges and paler in the centre. Cool on the trays for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack and cool completely. Store in a cookie jar for up to 3 days.</li>
        </ol>
